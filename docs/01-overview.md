# Overview

Pulsar is not an HTTP framework. 
It's a toolkit that provides a set of helper functions to build HTTP servers with [Bun](https://bun.sh).

It's designed to be simple, fast and lightweight.

## Features

Pulsar is type-safe and provides the following features:

- **Routing**: Define routes and group them under common prefixes.
- **Middleware**: Modify requests and responses on the fly.
- **Responses**: Create response easily with helper functions.
- **Plugins**: Extend the functionality with official pre-built middlewares.
